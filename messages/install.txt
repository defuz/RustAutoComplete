RustAutoComplete
================

A binding for Sublime Text to the Rust auto completion tool
by Phil Dawes (https://github.com/phildawes/racer).

Features
========

    * Auto complete (invoked automatically on Rust files).
    * Go to definition (default key binding is F2).

Status
======

Initial version. Works on the basic projects I have tested on.
Partially works on Servo when the search paths are set correctly.

Pull requests for fixes and new features are very welcome.

I have only tested this on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). It may work on
Mac / Windows.

Requirements
============

1) Install the Rust syntax highlighting package from Package Control:
    https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Rust

2) Clone and build the auto completion tool racer:
    https://github.com/phildawes/racer

3) Configure the plugin to be able to find the racer executable and
    Rust source code. Create a file called RustAutoComplete.sublime-settings
    in your Packages/User directory, using below as a template:

    // Copy this and place into your Packages/User directory.
    {
        // The full path to the racer binary. If racer is already
        // in your system path, then this default will be fine.
        "racer": "racer",

        // A list of search paths. This should generally just
        // be the path to the rust compiler src/ directory.
        "search_paths": [
            "/home/git/rust-lang/rust/src"
        ]
    }
